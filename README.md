Maven JDK11 Jigsaw Example
=========================

Status
------
 * Currently not more than a Proof of Concept 
 * Everything here is speculative!
 * Currently only 'maven-example' is switched to Java 11

Overview
--------

 * Example how could jmod/jlink work together in a Maven build 
 (using [`maven-jlink-plugin`](https://github.com/apache/maven-jlink-plugin/)
 and [`maven-jmod-plugin`](https://github.com/apache/maven-jmod-plugin/)
 Maven [plugins](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/)).
 
 TODO
 ----
 
 * Try to successfully add a dependency, e.g. JavaFX.
